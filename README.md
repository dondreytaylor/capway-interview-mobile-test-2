## Requirements

Develop a full feed containing interactive posts in accordance to the following requirements.

- Fork this repo before making any changes
- Frequently commit your changes to GIT, with proper messages on each commit.
- Colors should be the same hex/rgb values that appear within the screenshots
- Code should be well documented, with adequate comments explaining relevant sections.
- Designs should scale down to at least iPhone 5 (preferrably using AutoLayout)
- Create each post contained within the feed.
- You do not need to include comments under each post.
- Ignore all animations. The zoom in effect that appears when tapping an image does not need to be replicated.
- Use high resolution dummy images for profile pictures and post pictures
- Find equivalent icons in place of icons present within the design
- Tapping on an image in the feed should enlarge the image. The enlarged image can appear within a popup and does not need to transition from the feed.
- Tapping on the user profile picture and post icons does not need to go anywhere nor do anything.
- Added at least 15 posts with random photos onto the feed.

### BONUS:
- Make the images tappable within the profile. Tapping the image should bring up a popup containing that image.
- Add a UIPanGesture to the popup allowing you to drag it around.
