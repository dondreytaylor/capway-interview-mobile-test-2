## Requirements

Develop a full content and messaging feed containing interactive posts in accordance to the following requirements.

- Fork this repo before making any changes
- Frequently commit your changes to GIT, with proper messages on each commit.
- Colors should be the same hex/rgb values that appear within the screenshots
- Code should be well documented, with adequate comments explaining relevant sections.
- Designs should scale down to at least iPhone 5 (preferrably using AutoLayout)
- Create each post contained within the feed.
- Added at least 15 posts with random photos onto the feed.
- The profile pictures should be randomized and side swippable.
- Use high resolution dummy images for profile pictures and post pictures
- Find equivalent icons in place of icons present within the design
- Tapping on a post should enlarge the image. The enlarged image can appear within a popup and does not need to transition from the feed.
- Tapping on the user profile picture and post icons does not need to go anywhere nor do anything.
- Tapping on the search icon in the top header does not need to do anything
- Tapping on the navigation icons does not need to change the screen
- Tapping on the message icon at the top right should change to a new screen displaying messages (see screen located on the right)
- Tapping the back icon from the messaging screen should take you back to the feed.
- Add 10 messages with a random profile picture, name, message, and time.
- The messaging screen should be vertically scrollable


### BONUS:
- Add a UIPanGesture to the image popup allowing you to drag it around.
